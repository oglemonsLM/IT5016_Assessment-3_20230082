Python excels at developing projects fast due to the fact that you don't have to worry about compiling the code and it is easy to tell where the errors in your code are.

So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
    So far the most difficult moment for me was working on my ticketing software, the reason for this is because I have minimal prior experience in python and coding is not my strong suit.

Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
    No I do not, I don't consider myself a developer as I don't plan to be fully releasing any code publicly just yet.

Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before 
in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
    I have some degree of mastery of the Rubik's cube as I know how to solve one fully, it only took a few hours of watching tutorials on YouTube.

 If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
    It would say "Learn more python early on."

Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
    Yes, I took a break every 20 minutes to do some arm and leg stretches and drink some water.
